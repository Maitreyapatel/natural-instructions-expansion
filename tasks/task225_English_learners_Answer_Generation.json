            "input": "i wonder whether reading the articles of the journals similar to the economist\n(including _time_ , etc) are in a style that make them difficult to flow even\nfor native-readers?\nis the effort to read them is as smooth as other every day text for a native\nspeaker (not a language learner)? for example consider the first paragraph of\nthe following article:\n> sepahua, a ramshackle town on the edge of peru's amazon jungle, nestles in a\n> pocket on the map where a river of the same name flows into the urubamba.\n> that pocket denotes a tiny patch of legally loggable land sandwiched between\n> four natural reserves, all rich in mahogany and accessible from the town.\n> 'boundaries are on maps,' says a local logger, 'maps are only in lima,' the\n> capital.\nas a non-native speaker i can read almost all academic papers in various\nfields smoothly. it's not the case for the economist. the above example is not\na complex one the context neither in vocabulary. but its sentences are\ncomposed in an unnatural way. so the question is: are any native speakers with\na bachelor degree able to flow the economist as smooth as wikipedia articles?\nthere are certainly far better examples to support the question, such as the\nfollowing sentence which is convoluted enough to puzzle even native english\nspeakers:\n> 'that they were mysteriously thwarted by democrats over the measure for\n> three legislative sessions in a row suggests that some compromise may still\n> be possible, if only behind closed doorsand, perhaps, among the university\n> working groups that right now are hammering out what campus carrya phrase\n> that almost everyone seems to have a strong view onactually means.'\n<url>\nlaw-may-yet-er-backfire-revenge-nerds",
            "output": "**yes, the prose feels 'artificially complex' because it's 'literary\nnonfiction.'**\nyour frustration is completely understandable. you can read sophisticated\nscientific publications and absorb information-dense wikipedia articles\neasily, but this article feels awkward for you to read. the prose in the\narticle could indeed be described as 'artificially complex,' but whether\n'artificially complex' is good or bad depends on your opinion of literary\nnonfiction.\n> literary nonfiction is a type of prose that employs the literary techniques\n> usually associated with fiction or poetry to report on persons, places, and\n> events in the real world.\n# the literary article\nwhy does this article feel different than your average scientific publication?\nwhy do i call it 'literary'?\n## exhibit a: the phrase, 'of the same name'\nthe first item on our list of literary aspects to examine is the phrase, 'of\nthe same name,' which forced me (a native english speaker) to reread the first\nsentence twice.\n> sepahua, a ramshackle town _blah_ _blah_ _blah_ _blah_ _blah_ ' _blah_\n> _blah_ _blah_ , _blah_ _blah_ _blah_ _blah_ _blah_ _blah_ _blah_ _blah_\n> _blah_ river of the same name _blah_ _blah_ _blah_ _blah_.\nthis sentence states the name of the town at the beginning, then inserts the\nphrase 'of the same name' towards the end, asking the reader to have kept\ntrack of the name from beginning to end. i posit that simply repeating the\nname 'sepahua' would more simply communicate the information, but i wouldn't\ncall charles dickens 'pretentious' for selecting a phrase like that for a\nnovel. maybe the author likes the sound of the phrase, or maybe the author\nwants to highlight the fact that the town and the river are connected -- more\non that later.\n## exhibit b: the metaphor, 'nestles in a pocket'\nnext let's look at a more traditional literary device, the metaphor.\n> ...a ramshackle town... nestles in a pocket... where [two rivers meet].\nthe metaphor 'nestles in a pocket' evokes an image of a kitten snuggling into\nthe folds of grandma's apron. compare that to the wikipedia entry for an\namazonian city:\n> manaus or manaos before <number> or (formerly) barra do rio negro, is the\n> capital city of the state of amazonas in the north region of brazil. _it is\n> situated near the confluence of the negro and solimoes rivers._ with a\n> population of more than <number> million, it is the most populous city of both the\n> brazilian state of amazonas and the amazon rainforest.\ni'm not going to say that's a well written introduction, but if that's the\ntype of writing a reader is used to, then 'nestles in a pocket' will\ndefinitely feel like an awkward way to describe the geographic location of a\ntown.\nbefore you proclaim that 'confluence' is a randomly chosen thesaurus entry for\n'junction,' note that 'confluence' specifically refers to the place where two\nrivers join. again i'm not calling the prose here 'good,' rather the example\nserves to highlight why the economist article feels different.\nalso, consider why the author might want to give you the 'warm, fuzzy feeling'\nfrom a phrase like 'nestles in a pocket.' the author is trying to transport\nthe reader to the town.\n## exhibit c: the hyperbolic quote: 'maps are only in lima'\nturn back to the economist article to the quote in the last sentence of the\nfirst paragraph:\n> 'boundaries are on maps... maps are only in lima'\nwhile this quote doesn't convey a scientific fact about logging in the amazon,\nthe quote tries to give the reader some context with which to better\nunderstand why logging regulation has proven a stubborn problem. in the first\nparagraph, the reader learns about this remote town where local loggers scoff\nat big city regulators' attempts at drawing lines through the untameable\namazon jungle. who knows if this quote accurately portrays the attitudes of\nprofessional amazon loggers? for that reason the quote would be struck from a\nscientific publication. still, the flowery imagery is meant to transport the\nreader to the amazon jungle to get the needed perspective for the rest of the\narticle.\n# other articles from the economist\nscanning a few random economist articles, i find that many, but not all, of\nthe authors try similarly to give them a literary feel.\nfor contrast, consider this economist daily chart entry, 'americans are richer\nthan they were in the 0000s'. the opening paragraph probably feels much more\nlike the wikipedia description.\n> america's economy has grown massively during the past four decades, but not\n> all of its workers have reaped the rewards. perhaps the statistic most cited\n> to demonstrate how unequal the gains have been is the median household\n> income. official statistics from the census bureau show that this number has\n> remained flat for <number> years. however, a recent analysis by the congressional\n> budget office (cbo) found that it actually rose by <number>% between <number> and\n> <number>. why are the cbo's numbers so much cheerier?\nnote that unlike the 'trade, timber and tribes' article, this article didn't\ndedicate an entire paragraph to a personal connection with someone affected by\nthe information in the article. the information density of the sentences is\nroughly the same, but the diction and phrasing in the daily chart is more\nstraightforward and plain. even so, note that the word selection (e.g.,\n'massively' and 'cheerier') give the prose a bit more flavor than the\nwikipedia article, but not so much that i'm looking for the nearest kitten to\nhug.\n# a non-literary alternative article\nthis article deeply disturbs the fellow who despises literary flourishes and\nemotional appeals. not only the style, but much of the content of the article\nwould be struck from an academic publication. if you cut through all the fluff\nin the article, you're left with two relevant facts that it's trying to\ncommunicate. give it a sentence for context and a sentence of conclusion, and\nyou're left with this:\n> in <number>, the government of peru auctioned off logging rights in regions of\n> the amazon with <number>-year permits to log <number>% of the area each year. recently, a\n> report performed by peru's forestry regulator found that only <number> of the <number>\n> regions it investigated contained as much mahogany as the loggers claimed.\n> despite the underreported logging, a study by the carnegie institution,\n> using satellite data from <number> to <number>, concluded that the policy succeeded\n> in limiting damage to the forest. this leaves reason to continue the policy,\n> though questions remain as to how to increase enforcement to further reduce\n> illegal logging.\n(side note: i wish i had read those <number> sentences instead of the article. for me\nit wasn't the style that bugged me, but the lack of meaningful content.\nseriously, why on earth is there a random paragraph telling me that there's\nstill <number> uncontacted tribes in the amazon? what does that have to do with\ndeforestation?)\n# conclusion\nback to your question: 'is the language of the economist artificially\ncomplex?'\nin answering your question, i've tried to show here that the answer is both\n'yes' and 'that's not necessarily a bad thing.' furthermore i wanted to break\ndown what i mean by 'literary nonfiction,' which i think is why this article\nfeels different from wikipedia and academic articles.\nin terms of pure utility, both the style and the content of the article\ninefficiently conveys the relevant facts of the news story. however, for some\npeople this style of writing is more enjoyable to read than something that\nmore plainly states facts. furthermore one could argue that literary\ntechniques can more effectively (note: not the same as 'efficiently') convey\ninformation, but that's subjective.\nyour frustration with literary prose as a non-native speaker is\nunderstandable. indeed, many if not most native speakers are frustrated right\nalong with you. i suspect that 'native english speakers who read the\neconomist' is not a representative sample of native english speakers in\ngeneral.",

                "it's unclear what you mean by 'every final letter' (and i wouldn't say _every\nletter is dropped_ ), but i'll start off by classifying english accents into\ntwo main categories:\n0. **rhotic accents:** rhotic accents are ones in which the _r_ is pronounced in all positions ( _red, park, car_ ; the r in all these words is pronounced). most american and canadian accents are rhotic (there are also rhotic accents in britain).\n0. **non-rhotic accents:** non-rhotic accents are ones where the _r_ sound is only pronounced when it comes before a vowel sound (not the vowel letters _a e i o u_ ), so the r is pronounced in _red, arrive, car is_ but not in _bar, park, card_ etc. most english-english accents are non-rhotic (there are also non-rhotic accents in the us such as new york and boston). so the final (and pre-consonantal) r's in non-rhotic accents aren't pronounced.\nother consonants that are usually affected in speech include _p, t, k_. i\nwouldn't say they're dropped but rather 'unreleased'. if you have noticed, _p\nt k_ are produced by blocking the air at a particular place of articulation\nand then the blocked air is released:\n* _p_ is made by blocking the air at the lips\n* _t_ is made by blocking the air at the ridge just above the top teeth (called alveolar ridge)\n* _k_ is made by blocking the air at the velum (the soft palate)\nsometimes in word-final positions (and before certain other consonants),\nnative speakers block the air for _p t k_ and don't release it (=\n'unreleased'), so they can be inaudible.\nthere's another phenomenon called 'glottalisation' that happens to word-final\n(or syllable-final or pre-consonantal) _t_ 's in some accents (chiefly\nbritish). what happens is that the closure for the _t_ (which is normally made\nat the ridge) is made in the glottis (= glottal stop).\nfurther, as pointed out in graham's answer, the _-ing_ in some accents such as\nsouthern us, cockney and aave is reduced to _-in_ (i.e. from // to [n]) so\nwords like _singing, going, morning_ are reduced to _singin', goin', mornin'_.\nthat is called **ng droppin'**.\nincidentally, most (perhaps all) non-rhotic speakers usually insert consonants\nthat are not present in spelling (ghost consonants!), for instance, [w] in\n_go[ **w** ]away_, [j] ('y') in _he[ **j** ]is_ and (the striking) [] ('r')\nin _saw[ **** ]a film_ or _idea[ **** ]of_. i've explained them in this\nanswer to a question asking 'is 'idea of' pronounced 'idearof'?'."

'mr. john smith' is fine. 'mr. john' is really weird unless\nyou are in some parts of the american south, and even then, i'm not sure you'd\naddress a letter that way in a business context.\nsecond of all, part of why it feels weird is that in your example you address\na woman as 'mrs.' at least in the us, one does not ever address a woman as\n'mrs.' in a business context unless she has specifically indicated that it's\nher preferred title (same rules as 'capt.' and 'rev.') **precisely because it\nrefers to her marital status**. the reason it feels weird to address a man and\na woman that way when they're not married is that the 'mrs' title is\nexplicitly making a comment about her being married. that is why using 'mrs.'\nis considered gauche in the workplace. same with 'miss'.\nthe professional default title one uses for a woman is 'ms.' and she is\naddressed 'madam' (parallel to 'mr.'/'sir'). you may find that\n> dear mr. wu and ms. smith\nfeels a lot less weird.\nshould you find yourself needing to use 'mrs.' (say, in a social context, like\nwriting wedding invitations), there's a whole archaic set of rules for its\ncorrect use, about which i am very hazy.

(overlapping is possible.) however, more often\nthan not, an esl learner breaks this order, usually by learning to read and\nstudying grammar first, before they can listen well enough. not to mention\ntheir speaking skill. (and i was one of them.)\nin your case, you can read well enough already. this is good. now, there are\ntwo possible fastest approaches that i can think of, to improve your writing\nskill. the first approach is **start writing now** , and then check your\nwriting against grammar rules, and possibly against the books you have read.\nthis will improve your writing skill quickly, at first, but not by much in the\nlong run.\nanother approach, which i would like to suggest, but more challenging, is to\n**learn to speak first**. by learning to speak, i mean you make yourself speak\nspontaneously, the way native speakers do. if you have some native speakers\nwho are willing to help you, this will be easy. if not, you still have tv,\nyoutube, movies, and so on, as your resources.\n* this might be the opposite of what you want ( _'i want good writing then good speaking'_ ), but i found that it's much more effective. (i changed my learning style about two years ago. before then, i need to spend so much time just to write a short paragraph. now i can write it as fast as my fingers allow, at about the same speed that i can type in my first language.)\nit might start slow, but be persistent. keep practicing. at least to the point\nthat you can communicate confidently, if need be. you will notice that your\nvocabulary size will explode. to be able to communicate, you will need words,\nand you will observe those words you heard more intently. soon enough, you\nwill find that writing is not that difficult anymore. and if you want to\nimprove your writing further, you can refine your writing skill by studying\ngrammar later. (i'm doing exactly that now.) in my opinion, this approach is\nmuch better in the long run.\nhope this helps."

'i' is the subject and 'you' is the object.\n* 'you see me.' 'you' is the subject and 'me' is the object.\nthis is a _gross_ oversimplification, but it's a solid starting point.\nusing this same logic, let's assume you are asked the question, 'who did\nthat?' refer to my rule above, where i said, 'the subject is the one that is\n_doing_ something.' the correct answer would be 'i,' 'i did,' or 'i did that.'\nin colloquial speaking, however, a majority of native english speakers would\nlikely respond 'me,' but ironically, the same people would never say 'me did'\nor 'me did that.' the easiest way to speak grammatically correctly _and_ sound\ncompletely natural is to simply include the verb in your response: 'i did.'\nalso, keep in mind that 'i' and 'me' always come last in a series of nouns\nand/or pronouns. 'you and i went together' is correct, while 'i and you went\ntogether' is not. some examples:\n* 'john, maria, and i studied together last night.' 'i' must come last in the list of subjects who studied together.\n* 'the professor helped john, maria, and me study last night.' 'me' must come last in the list of objects who were helped by the professor.\nit's just a hard rule: include 'i' and 'me' last whenever you have a series of\ntwo or more subjects/objects listed together."

(buying old people is nonsense, but we may still want to keep our\ngrammar clear.)\nas i said above, in some contexts only one of the sentences is correct. the\nmain reason is the difference between 'the' and 'these'.\n'the' generally means something definite. (there are many reasons why nouns\ncan be definite -- that we've talked about them, that they're unique, that\nwe're giving a broader description like 'the girl who broke my heart' -- and\nyou can research that more on your own if you want to know it better.)\n'these' describes a plural something which is spoken of like we're pointing to\nit or like it's 'nearer' than something else ('nearer' as in space or time).\nhere are a few examples to clarify:\n> do you like these shoes? (someone is holding shoes, wearing shoes, or\n> pointing to shoes.)\n>\n> the first band's songs were terrible, but i like these songs a lot. (we're\n> comparing songs played more recently to songs played earlier.)\n>\n> i'm tired of these phone calls from people i don't know!

(there's no 'these' feeling,\n> but we are speaking specifically about the sports cars which were just\n> mentioned.)\n>\n> corvette makes sports cars in a variety of styles. young people usually buy\n> these sports cars. (in this case we wish to say _which_ red sports cars, and\n> the speaker is probably pointing to them or has otherwise indicated a subset\n> of _red_ sports cars.)\n>\n> sports cars have been around for a long time, and young people usually\n> didn't buy them. however, this is the new line and young people buy these\n> sports cars."

(i'm\nillustrating with us pronunciations, but i don't think that british\npronunciation in these instances would call for different arguments.)\n* english doesn't much like 'closed' syllablessyllables which end on a consonant. in speech we prefer our syllables as 'open' as possible: the happiest ending is a vowel, next is a more vowel-like consonant (a continuant), next is a voiced stop, and last is a voiceless stop. other things being equal, a consonant or consonant cluster at the end of a syllable tends to be reduced towards vowelness.\nfor instance, in speaking _last man_ , the voiceless stop /t/ will tend to be\ndropped: /ls mn/. in speaking _canned peas_ , the voiced stop /d/ will tend\nto be dropped: /kn piz/.\n* however, if the following syllable begins with a vowel, the consonant or cluster can be 'tied' to it, leaving the preceding syllable 'open': _last ever_ becomes /l stvr/. but this only works to the extent that the tied consonant cluster is acceptable at the beginning of a syllable. /st/ is a common syllable onset, but english syllables never begin with /nd/; so in speaking _canned okra_ the cluster is split, leaving /kn dokr/.\n* that would lead you to expect _and eighty_ to be pronounced as /n de/. but in practice, unstressed _and_ is almost always reduced to mere /n/. in this instance that principle comes into play **first** , before the liaison takes place. consequently, you end up with /ne/."

                "first of all, 'geek' is slang, so it is much less about strict definition than\nit is about the associations that speakers have with the term and the people\nit is applied to.\nsecond, those associations have been changing quite a bit recently.\nthird, some groups make distinctions between this word and some related words\n(principally 'nerd'), while others treat them as synonymous.\nso this is going to be a long answer, where i try to impart the associations\nthat i have, and i have seen others have, using the word.\nanyway, with that in mind, 'geek' was originally an insult, and is sometimes\nstill used that way though that is diminishing recently. specifically, it\nmeant to imply that the geek in question shares some of the qualities\nassociated with a particular stereotype.\nthat stereotype has been eroded recently, but we'll start with the original\nstereotype, particularly its depictions in movies and television, which\ninformed many english-speakers of the stereotype and thus which people could\nbe called geeks. but first,\n### the 'too long, didn't read' version\noriginally, geek was an insult referencing a stereotypical high school clique,\nassociated with poor social skills and an unfathomable interest in math,\nscience, or other technical and unpopular matters. it became more broadly\napplied to any kind of interest that others without the same interests\ncouldn't understand. between the broadening of who could be considered a geek,\nand years of movies and television portraying geeks as the underdog\nprotagonist, the term has been reclaimed, and many people now refer to\nthemselves as geeks and would not be insulted by being called one.\nultimately, however, its history as an insult means that it should be used\nwith some care.\n### the original stereotype\n'the geeks' are depicted, in media, as a kind of archetypal school clique, at\nleast in america. the stereotypical depiction is a small and skinny (or, on\nthe flip side, obese: primarily, not physically fit) white (both as in\ncaucasian, and as in being particularly pale) male, with neither talent nor\ninterest in sports or physical activity, and a passion for science,\nmathematics, or other technical matters that his classmates do not share.\nthey are contrasted with various other archetypal cliques. again,\nstereotypically, the geeks are a small group, close to the bottom of the\nsocial ladder, and often lack much social skill (read: awkward and nervous\naround girls, unable to convincingly stand up to bullies or even engender much\nsympathy from others while being bullied). they do tend to be portrayed with\nfairly close friendships within the clique, however. 'the geeks' typically are\ncontrasted with 'the jocks,' the athletes, who are usually the most popular\nguys in school.\nthis, of course, mirrored reality to _some_ degree, though no school is\nactually exactly as depicted in movies or television.\nnow, while stereotypically, media frequently depicts geeks as being interested\nin technical matters, this was never (so far as i can tell) the true mark of\nthe geek. for instance, being interested in car mechanics has almost never\nbeen seen as geeky: cars are cool, popular, even sexy, definitely not geeky.\non the other hand, interest in superhero comics, video games and even more so\ntabletop games, fantasy and science fiction media, and so on have all been\nassociated with geeks, even though these are not at all technical. it is far\nmore about being interested in unpopular things than it is about math and\nscience (though these subjects are typically fairly unpopular in adolescence).\n### expanded application: _any_ strong interest in an activity\nthe word geek is also appended to all manner of activities to indicate a very\nstrong interest in it. 'drama geek' is a very common term for people\ninterested in theater for example, for example. note that more popular or\nphysical activities are still rarely associated with the term, however, unless\nthe interest goes well beyond what is popular. for example, dancing is quite\npopular; enjoying dance or being good at it is unlikely to be described as\ngeeky. but someone who really gets into dance theory and practices dance\nregularly for its own sake _might_ be called a dance geek (though i'll admit\ni've never heard that particular usage).\nalso, people who do something professionally, or at an expert level, are\nrarely described as geeks (unless one is discussing their origins); a movie\nstar might say they got their start as a drama geek, but it would be unusual\nto call them a drama geek now. ultimately, i suspect this is simply because\nthe term was supposed to be an insult; it's hard to insult someone's interests\nwhen those interests make them money or are recognized as world-class.\n### broadened demographics\nfurthermore, the associations have changed with time. non-white geeks (the\nchinese or indian geek has become almost as bad a stereotype as the original\npale geek), female geeks, and physically-fit geeks have become much more\ncommon. depictions of geeks with notable social skills are less common, but\nmore often their social skills are depicted as merely 'normal,' rather than\nsub-par.\n### narrative role\nit's really important to remember that geeks were an important part of\namerican movies and television. in particular, they served the role of the\nunderdog protagonist in a lot of media based in american high schools (roughly\nage 00-00). they were bullied, socially anxious, and unpopular, which made\nthem easy to relate to. this became especially pronounced as more interests\ncould be associated with geeks, and geeks' social ineptitude shifted to more\ntypical teenager awkwardness.\n### reclamation\nin recent years, geek has become a largely reclaimed term. many people proudly\nlabel themselves geek, including people who really wouldn't have fit the\nstereotype and probably never would have had it used against them as a\nstereotype. 'geeking out' just means to get excited about something that\ndoesn't excite everyone, which almost anyone will do on occasion. furthermore,\nthe technical fields that were originally associated with geeks have become\nmuch more popular, thanks to the explosion of personal computers and the\ninternet.\nthese days, geekiness is a fairly popular trait, and being a geek is not\nreally seen as being a member of a clique so much as just having interests\nparticular to you that get you really excited. the primary qualification is\nthat you can get excited about something, and have others be completely\nbaffled by your excitement. for instance, i get really excited about new forms\nof web technology, mark-up languages, and programming. plenty of people in my\nlife would be completely mystified if i tried to explain why some development\nhad me excited, though.\nthis definition, of course, is exceptionally broad, and almost anyone can\nself-label themselves a geek, and it's become increasingly difficult to\nactually use as an insult if one were so inclined, because a lot of people see\nit as a good thing in the first place. for example, john green has a fairly\npopular video which includes the following quote about how 'nerd' is a weak\ninsult:\n> because nerds like us are allowed to be unironically enthusiastic about\n> stuff nerds are allowed to love stuff, like jump-up-and-down-in-the-chair-\n> can't-control-yourself love it. hank, when people call people nerds, mostly\n> what they're saying is 'you like stuff.' which is just not a good insult at\n> all. like, 'you are too enthusiastic about the miracle of human\n> consciousness.'\nthat said, this is a rather recent change in the popular understanding of the\nterm, and some, particularly those who are older and grew up with its use as a\nnegative, may still see it as an insult. certainly, the original stereotype of\na geek _is_ fairly insulting."

(see: <url> for\nmore details on this)\nthe ability to spell the same sound in many different ways is useful, because\nthere are many words that sound the same, but have different meanings. 'there'\nand 'their' is one famous example. even though these sound exactly alike, it\nis useful to have different spellings for them, because the meaning is very\ndifferent.\nspellings can also give you information about the 'root' of the word, or its\norigin, or even its history. english borrows words from other languages very\noften, and we typically like to keep the original spelling from the original\nlanguage, even though our spelling rules may be different. over time, the way\npeople say words can also change, but we usually keep the spelling the same.\n(for example, the word 'knight' used to be pronounced 'kh'ni'git', which is\nmore or less how it is spelled, but when we changed how the word sounded, we\ndid not change how to spell it)\nspelling can also inform you about the grammatical function of the word. to\nuse your example, 'titanic', this word comes from the word 'titan' and the\nsuffix '-ic', which makes the noun into an adjective. this '-ic' ending,\nhowever, can only be used with words that come from certain languages,\nspecifically latin or greek. so by seeing that the word ends in '-ic', we know\nthat the word comes from latin or greek, and is an adjective. knowing that the\nword comes from latin or greek is important because the origin of the word\ntells us a lot about how formal the word is. for instance, latin or greek\nwords are much more formal than german words.\nsometimes there is no real reason for one letter to be used over another, but\nonce a letter was picked, it just stays that way forever."

(i recommend skipping _the giving tree_ , though.) these are great for reading aloud. the grammar in children's poetry is usually easy-to-understand. (the grammar in adult poetry can be very twisted, in order to satisfy arbitrary rhythm, meter, and rhyme rules. you might have noticed this problem in _othello_.)\n* **good** english translations of books that you already enjoy and are familiar with. for example, if you are christian, you could read an english translation of the bible that is approved by your denomination. if you are french, i recommend the philips bradley edition of _democracy in america_.\n* books that teach you something useful. for example, _how to lie with statistics_ , or _how to win friends and influence people_. (the pre-0000 editions of _how to win friends and influence people_ have lots of great examples.)\n* choose fiction books that you like. read the back cover blurb, and a random page. if you don't like it, skip it! there are lots of other good books to choose from.\n\\-- consider golden age science fiction, such as short stories by asimov,\nniven, or heinlein.\n\\-- consider mysteries. after reading a few stories in a mystery series, you\nwill notice that all the stories in the series seem similar. so move on to a\ndifferent series. some popular mystery series are: _nancy drew_ , _the hardy\nboys_ , _trixie belden_ , _alfred hitchcock and the three investigators_ , and\nlarry block's _the burglar_ series. the earliest books in each mystery series\ntend to be the best."

'develop' implies that the thing\nwhich is developing already exists in a fundamental way, whereas 'generate'\nimplies that things are being newly created. if we mean to say that the\n'system' creates misnathropes that did not exist before, we should therefore\nuse 'generate.'"

                "**< tl;dr>** the difference between **rights** and **privileges** is\ncritically dependent on the context in which the words are employed. that\nsaid, there are some general guidelines and common exceptions that are\ndiscussed below.\nthere are two closely related definitions of the word _right_ that are\nrelevant here:\n> proper claims that justly accrue to everyone; one's due\nconsider the following quote from plato's dialog _philebus_ (translator:\nbenjamin jowett)\n> if, as is natural, we begin by thinking of ourselves first, we are easily\n> led on to think of others; for we cannot help acknowledging that what is\n> right for us is the **right** and inheritance of others.\nbut this definition is philosophically general and doesn't tell us any\noperational detail. so, a right is also\n> the justifiable legal or moral claim to the possession of something, the\n> authority to take some action, or the ability to enjoy some situation\n> without interference.\nthis enhanced definition tells us that a right is codified by some authority\nto which right holders may appeal to claim that right. for instance, when you\nbuy a house, you gain the right of ownership. you possess the house; it's\nyours. you also get the right of exclusion: you may take legal action to\nprevent trespassing. and you get the right of enjoyment of that property: no\none may legally forbid you from holding a quiet lawn party at your house.\nnote the general applicability of rights. certainly you have to buy a house to\nhave the bundle of rights that come with the ownership of real property, but\nthese rights flow to everybody who owns a house. a privilege is a special kind\nof right, one enjoyed by a person or group of people, beyond (and perhaps even\nprejudicial to) the general rights of others. this can take the form of a\nspecial exemption from some duty.\nfor instance, members of the united states congress hold a privilege of\nimmunity for anything they say conducting public business on the floor of\ntheir chambers. they may not be arrested for making threats there, and they\ncannot be sued for defamation for speaking slander there. this is in stark\ncontrast to the rest of us who have no such refuge from the law.\nyou will hear people recite the formulaic, 'it was a **privilege** to know\nyou.' meaning that the benefits of your wisdom and sparkling personality were\navailable to the speaker and not generally available to those you didn't make\nacquaintance with.\nhowever, context is everything, and rights may be labeled _basic_ **rights** ,\n_human_ **rights** , or (in the us) _constitutional_ **rights**. it is implied\nthat claims to these kind of rights are particularly strong. in the us, the\noperating theory of government is that these rights are god-granted, and the\nstate must take extraordinary care to protect them. in this view, some\nprivileges have a lesser standing, and you may hear the statement:\n> driving is **privilege** , not a **right**.\nwhich means that the state has a far easier task to keep you from driving than\nsay, from speaking freely. driving is not a constitutional right; free speech\nis. a conviction for drunk driving may erase your legal right to drive, but\nthere are some constitutional rights so sturdy that you may not waive them\neven if you wanted to.\na parent might say to a teenager\n> remember that a midnight curfew is a **privilege** , so don't be late.\nchildren have a right to safety, food, shelter, and an education as mandated\nby law and parents may not legally violate those rights. but a late date-night\ncurfew is entirely within parental control and may be revoked even on a whim.\nbut, as you may have noted, the privileged speech of members of the us\ncongress is as strong a right as any listed in the bill of rights. in fact,\nthe us constitution has a privileges and immunities clause (article iv,\nsection 0) which prevents one state from discriminating against the citizens\nof another state. the supreme court has declared that in that context the\nmeaning of the word _privileges_ is basic rights.\nthus, see the warning at the top."

(you could actually also use\na _colon_ in the same way.)\nboth these sentences are correct:\n> i mean, i know what a hammer is used for.\n> i mean, how should i know what a hammer is used for?\nthe one remaining question is, whether we should use _know_ of _find out_.\nwell, that depends, like i said, on what you want to say.\nif you want to say 'i don't know what a hammer is used for, and i mean to ask\nyou how i can find out', then you use _find out_. _find out_ is used if you\nmean to _learn_ something. i actually assume that this is the sentence as you\nmeant to form it:\n> **i mean, how can i find out what a hammer is used for?**\non the other hand, if somebody assumes that you know what a hammer is used\nfor, but you don't, you might want to ask them why they assume you know that.\nhow could you? they know you have never seen or used a hammer, so how can they\nassume that you know what it's for?\n> i mean, how do i know what a hammer is used for?\n> i mean, how could i know what a hammer is used for?\n> i mean, how should i know what a hammer is used for?\nall three sentences are _rhetorical_ questions: you do not really expect an\nanswer, you are basically making a statement. to exemplify the difference\nbetween _do_ , _could_ and _should_ i will paraphrase the _statements_ you\nmake in these three 'questions':\n> i do not know what a hammer is used for.\n> i could not possible know what a hammer is used for. i should not be\n> expected to know what a hammer is used for.\n**note** that i included the _do_ version only for completeness. of the three\noptions, i feel it is the least natural. it is important to understand that\n_know_ is about describing a state of knowing something, not about _learning_\nsomething:\n> how can i know this? <= _this does **not** mean 'how can i learn this?'\n> _it means:_ how can you assume that i know this? you are so wrong!"

'all i can do' is an idiom that means 'i can't do anything\nexcept', and 'sit and worry' is an idiom that means 'worry', but in a\nparticular way (more on which below).\nso right from the start, we have three verbs all used in conjunction to\ncommunicate the idea of not doing anything and feeling bad about it!\nand then, in the second part, we have grilling, going, and get. now, 'going\nto' is synonymous here with 'will' and is not functioning as a verb in its own\nright. now, the speaker could have said they were worried about 'being\ngrilled', but the choice to phrase it as 'a grilling' they're going to 'get',\nthey idiomatically suggest more aggression on the part of the griller. to be\ngrilled, by default just means to be asked a bunch of questions in a way which\nis demanding that one account for oneself. to _get a grilling_ suggests the\ngrilling will be punitive, the way one 'gets' a punishment, or a bad attitude,\nor a dressing-down.\nall of this adds up to the speaker saying that their worry is that this other\nparty will do something to them they don't like (grill them).\nso what this whole utterance boils down to is, 'i'm anxious [the unspecified\nother party] will feel angry with me.' two verbs: 'am' (be) and 'feel'. one\nfor the speaker and one for the other party.\nbut because the speaker, for whatever reasons, does not express themselves\nwith adjectives like 'anxious' and 'angry' (or nouns like 'anxiety' and\n'anger'), they are left expressing the idea in verbs, making heavy use of\nidioms that employ verbs to convey feelings.\nwhich brings us to 'sit'. this idiomatic use of 'sit and [verb]' (e.g. 'sit\nand think', 'sit and stew', 'sit and stare') uses sit _figuratively_ to mean\n'not take external action'. it establishes a contrast between outwardly\nobservable behavior (little to none at all) and inner behavior (in this cases,\nintense mental activity).\nso 'sit and worry' means, 'do nothing outwardly while churning emotionally\ninwardly'. in that sense, it's somewhat redundant of 'all i can do is'.\nwe have someone saying 'all i can do is', which means 'i can't do anything\nexcept', and 'sit and worry', which means 'do nothing outwardly and ruminate\ninwardly on my worry'; and then we have them saying that the thing they're\nworrying about, the 'grilling i'm going to get', which means 'the hostile\nconfrontation with which (i anticipate) this other person will greet me'.\nwhile there are shorter, more concise ways of expressing the same thing, the\nuse of all these verbs in idiomatic ways conveys pretty clearly to the astute\nlistener presumed familiar with the idioms in question the inner\nexperience which is actually the subject of that sentence, and it does so with\nquite a bit of nuance. it is not merely that the speaker feels worried, but\nthat they feel despairing: they anticipate they are about to be confronted\nhostilely, and there isn't anything they can do to stop it."

when march comes, the trees start blooming.\n0. in march the trees bloom.\nyou can play around with the wording, e.g.:\n* when march comes the trees begin to bloom.\n* come march, the trees begin to bloom.\nto say 'come march...' or 'come saturday...' or 'when it comes time to..'\nmerely means 'when march arrives...' or 'when saturday arrives...' or 'when\nit's time to...' it's a rather idiomatic way of speaking and might not be so\neasy for english language learners. however, if you move to a land of native\nenglish-speakers you will hear it. hence i include it here.\n> now and then a warm and gentle **rain will fall** accompanied by rolling\n> thunder.\nthat is grammatically correct and we may sometimes say it that way. however,\nwhen we are describing a season like this in english, normally we say:\n> now and then a gentle rains falls accompanied by rolling thunder.\nagain, i'm not sure why but it is the way we speak. we don't say 'rain will\nfall,' just 'rain falls.' normally, we say 'rain will fall' when we describe\nthe scientific cycle of evaporation and condescension that causes rain.\n> **after it ends** ,\nthat is grammatically correct but it sounds clumsy. we generally say something\nlike:\n* afterwards...\n* when the shower/rain is over...\n> **it might cover the sky with a beautiful arc of colourful light**.\nto understand your meaning for this, i had to read version 0. you mean a\nrainbow arcing across the sky.\n> **the spring** in uzbekistan is just magnificent.\nagain, this is grammatically correct but it is not the way we speak. we don't\nuse an article in front of _spring_ for this kind of sentence. we say:\n> spring in uzbekistan is just magnificent.\nfor an ell discussion on leaving out the article for some nouns, see omission\nof articles in phrases.\ni am not sure about using the word 'just.' maybe it is okay, or maybe it\nshould be omitted. in my mother-tongue we use it but i think my friends who\nhave all their lives spoken only english might not. they would put a lot of\nfeeling in the word 'magnificent' and say:\n> spring in uzbekistan is magnificent.\n**second version**\ni will continue with the same method of highlighting errors with bold-face for\ndiscussion.\n> **one of the most important places which i prefer in uzbekistan become\n> during spring.**\ni have to read version 0 to understand the meaning of this.\n> every year the trees **begin to blooming** in the beginning of march.\nthis is very good but not grammatically correct. the correct way is either:\n0. begin to bloom, or\n0. begin blooming.\nyou cannot use 'to' with a word that ends in 'ing.'\n> during the spring **there are gentle rain falls** with accompanying\n> thunderstorms.\nthis is grammatically correct except 'rainfalls' is one word. i think that\nsentence is cute or quaint: there are gentle rainfalls accompanied by\nthunderstorms.\nokay, i changed a few words around to make it smoother. the original is fine\nexcept for the split word. however, it is more common to say 'showers' instead\nof 'rainfalls.'\nalso, _thunderstorm_ sounds rather incongruent to accompany 'gentle rainfall'\nor 'gentle shower.' for this reason, i prefer 'rolling thunder' of version 0.\nanother common description of thunder that is not a violent storm is 'rumbling\nthunder.'\n> **after ending there is might be** beautiful rainbow in the sky.\nthis is wrong. i will divide it into two parts:\n* after ending\n* is might be\n**_after ending..._**\nwe have to say what is ending. since the previous part was about gentle rains\nand rolling thunder, it is reasonable to think this means when the showers\nend. we can say:\n> after the rainfall ends...\n**_...is might be..._**\nthe words 'is might be' never go together in a row like that. we cannot say:\nthere is might be...\nhere are two things we can say:\n0. there is...\n0. there might be...\nwe might rewrite your sentence like this:\n> after the rainfall (or shower) ends, there might be a beautiful rainbow in\n> the sky.\nplease note that i inserted the indefinite article 'a.' an article is needed\nin front of _rainbow_ in that sentence because it's just one of many rainbows\nthat appear in the sky.\n> in uzbekistan **the** spring is **just** magnificent.\nthis sentence is grammatically correct but somewhat clumsy. as discussed for\nversion 0, we do not put an article in front of _spring_ when used like this.\nas also discussed, the word 'just' is probably not needed. the best way to say\nit is:\n> spring in uzbekistan is magnificent.\n_magnificent_ is such a magnificent word, so superlative, like an apple trees\nin all its glory of pink blossoms against a clear blue sky, that no modifiers\nare needed. i don't know a better way of saying it but that is the impression\ni get from listening to english-speakers speak."

'the forces of big capital' is\neffectively one big noun. capital in this context means money, like in the\nword capitalism. it doesn't refer to a political capital, like washington dc\nis that capital of the united states. big capital is large corporations that\nhave a lot of money. the forces of big capital refers to how big corporations\nlike facebook have a lot of money, and that means they can effect our lives.\nsmaller companies can push with a little force. big companies can push with a\nlot of force.\nso, those forces are 'further extending into our everyday lives.' big\ncorporations already have some impact on our lives. but they are trying to\nhave even more control over our lives.\nsocial media sites like twitter are 'spaces.' space is a metaphor here -- it\ndoesn't mean you have to get in a space ship and fly into outer space to post\na tweet on twitter.\n... so, a very similar question that might be easier to pick apart:\n'are web sites like twitter and facebook being used by wealthy and powerful\ncompanies to have more power over our lives?'"

'which' is the beginning of a clause\nthat is _optional_ for understanding the meaning of the sentence. using 'that'\nmeans that the clause is _required_ for understanding the meaning.\ni'm going to borrow an example from the grammarly blog post about this:\n> my bike that has a broken seat is in the garage.\n>\n> my bike, which has a broken seat, is in the garage.\nthe first sentence, using 'that', implies that the speaker has more than one\nbike. the speaker is indicating that the _specific bike_ \\-- the one with a\nbroken seat -- is the one that is in the garage. the information about the\nbroken seat is _required_ to know which bike the speaker is talking about.\nin the second sentence, the speaker does _not_ imply they have more than one\nbike. the broken seat is just a way to _describe_ the bike, and that\ndescription could be removed without changing the meaning of the sentence.\nso, in the sentence about holidays, is the speaker _identifying_ the holidays,\nor _describing_ them? if the speaker is identifying the holidays, then 'that'\nis appropriate.\nbecause the sentences use 'which', it sounds like the speaker is _describing_\nthe holidays. that's totally valid usage. but if that is the case, then there\nshould be a comma before 'which'. optional clauses have commas at the\nbeginning and end -- though the end comma doesn't apply here, since the end of\nthe clause is also the end of the sentence.\n> i'm looking forward to the holidays, which are coming soon.\na comma is _not_ required if the sentence uses 'that':\n> i'm looking forward to the holidays that are coming soon.\nusing 'that' implies that the speaker is _only_ looking forward to the\nholidays that are coming soon. maybe they are not looking forward to the\nholidays that are coming further in the future."

'colloquial' describes the way people communicate casually,\ntypically in verbal conversation. so in that sense, the quoted text seems very\nstrange.\nhowever, the sentences in the quote structure are **somewhat typical** in an\nacademic or professional context. academic and other professional writing\nstyles often use longer, more grammatically complex sentences. they tend to do\nthis, because the content of their writing focuses on combining a lot of ideas\nand analyzing them all at once. they also use more complex words and grammar\nto be more precise. this happens in the quote you provide. so, in a sense, the\nquote is good english. it is functional and, with a lot of extra effort, can\nbe understood.\nhowever, your instincts are revealing something else that's important! number\ntwo of my list -- that the grammar is extra complicated. just because\nacademics **can** use overly complex sentences, doesn't mean they should. and\nin fact, using complicated sentences sometimes makes them harder to\nunderstand! when a writer uses complex grammar to make a sentence seem more\nimportant than it is, that shows that the writer isn't actually that good. the\nphrase 'short and sweet' comes to mind as a good counter-argument to the long\ncomplex sentences.\nalso the quoted text is only two sentences! and i bet the rest of that job\noffer is structured similarly. that is a lot of information to pack into only\ntwo sentences. the writer of that job offer would have done better to break\nthose two sentences into at least 0-0.\n* * *\n# about 'welcoming'\nso adjectives in english are quirky. english has a very specific order that\nadjectives are 'right' or 'grammatical' in. i have a link to a cute tumblr\npicture post about it and another article here.\n> adjectives in english absolutely have to be in this order: opinion-size-age-\n> shape-colour-origin-material-purpose noun. so you can have a lovely little\n> old rectangular green french silver whittling knife. but if you mess with\n> that word order in the slightest you'll sound like a maniac.\nin the case of 'welcoming,' part of why it's weird is that the writer is using\ntwo adjectives -- 'welcoming' and 'excellent' -- from the 'opinion' or\n'quality' category. the writer could have used only 'welcoming' in the job\noffer, but added 'excellent' because the job offer wants to target the highest\nquality workers. it's clumsy to use more than one adjective in the job offer.\nit's good to note that when we list adjectives, we **do need** some way to\nconnect them -- either through the addition of 'and,' or through adding\ncommas, which indicate a pause and that a connection is made in the text.\nboth your examples\n> to create an excellent and welcoming attitude\n> to create an excellent, welcoming attitude\nare grammatical and accurate. the writer of the job offer should have picked\none to use, which would have made the language clearer.\n# about 'attitude'\nto my knowledge, all of those\n> she created a good attitude at work\n> she formed a good attitude after work\n> she developed a good attitude at work\nall make sense, though all sound very formal. more common (and idiomatic) is\nusing the verb 'to have,' as in:\n> she has a good attitude at work\n> she had a bad mood before work\nfor this, it might come down to how the english language structures ideas\nabout opinions and moods, and emotions that people have. note, i am **not**\nreferring to 'grammatical mood' right now, which is something different. in\nenglish, for example, moods and opinions are something we have, that we\npossess inherently. we also use the verb 'to be' for moods and emotions.\n> she is sad\n> she is in a bad mood\nbut interestingly, it would be ungrammatical to say:\n> she is good attitude [ungrammatical]\nbecause of how the english language structures thought, attitudes are\nsomething we have. attitudes can also be something we make or change, but they\nseem to be something that changes infrequently, so it is something we 'have'.\n# about 'doing something'\nthis problem seems related to prepositions to me, but i take a while to get to\nthe point. so we've got:\n> (0) doing something through something else\n> (0) doing something through something else in doing something else\nin (0), the relationship between 'something' and 'something else' is a\nrelationship of cause and effect, **or** of noticing an effect and the place\nthe effect occurs in.\nso, '...[an excellent welcoming attitude] **through** [syntex corporate\nheadquarter]...'\n[an excellent welcoming attitude] is the effect and,\n[syntex corporate headquarter] is where the effect takes place.\nbut what causes the effect in the first place? well, 'the international guest\nrelation coordinator' does.\nbut how does the coordinator cause the effect?\nthat is demonstrated in (0): [an excellent welcoming attitude] **through**\n[syntex corporate headquarter] **in** [planning and executing international\nvisits].\n[planning and executing international visits] is the cause,\nand the effect is [an excellent welcoming attitude],\nwhich occurs in [syntax corporate headquarter]\n**rephrased short and sweet:** the coordinator plans something. the\ncoordinator executes something. the plan and the execution cause 'an excellent\nwelcoming attitude'. the 'excellent welcoming attitude' occurs in 'syntax\ncorporate headquarter'.\nso the original sentence, with my bold :\n> you will be responsible for all international groups coming to sydney and to\n> create an _excellent welcoming attitude_ **through** syntex corporate\n> headquarter **in** planning and executing international visits.\nmuch of the complication with 'doing something through something else' is\n**that the wrong prepositions are being used**. the whole sentence would make\nmore sense if we switched the bold prepositions. that leads to this example:\n> you will be responsible for all international groups coming to sydney and to\n> create _an excellent welcoming attitude_ **in** syntex corporate headquarter\n> **through** planning and executing international visits.\nin my example, **through** is serving the same purpose as **by** in your\nexample above. both prepositions indicate that there is a 'cause and effect'\nrelationship being described.\n# about singular vs plural\nto quote the the original quote:\n> the international guest relation coordinator is part of the global education\n> team to assist the preparation of programs and meetings\nfor why 'relation' is singular... my best guess is that the writer of the job\noffer was intending 'international guest relation coordinator' to be the whole\njob title. since the job title would only be for one person, and only about\none person, that is why 'relation' was made singular.\nin merriam-webster dictionary, 'relation' is actually a singular noun for\nentries 0-0 in the definition. in entries 0 and 0, it is listed as the plural\n'relations' with a slightly different meaning and connotation.\ngrammatically, both 'relation' and 'relations' are acceptable here. the\ndifference between them is small; both singular and plural forms indicate that\nthe job of the coordinator is focused on the connections between multiple\nguests, and connections between guests and non-guests.\nusing the word 'relation' has an implication that the coordinator acts and\nspeaks with the guests (probably to meet their needs).\nif 'relations' is used, it would imply more focus on the connections between\nguests, the guests interactions with each other, and the guests interactions\nwith others. there is slightly less emphasis on the coordinators individual\nrole...the coordinator is more of a mediator between others.\n> headquarter\nas for 'headquarter' you are right that it doesn't typically exist as\nsingular. it should be 'headquarters' instead. i would guess that this is a\ntypo, but it's also very possible the writer doesn't know this exception to\nthe usual singular/plural rules in english."

'tautosyllabic' means _being the same syllable_ , for example, the _n_ and _t_ in _ant_ are in the same syllable so they're tautosyllabic. 'coda' refers to the consonants after the nucleus (usually vowel) of the syllable (e.g. _nt_ in _ant_ ). according to english phonotactic constraints, english doesn't have obstruent + sonorant in the same syllable in the coda. (obstruents: _p, t, k, s, k, f_ etc. sonorants: _l, m, n_ etc.) note that this is entirely different from _obstruent + syllabic consonant_ sequence."

'know' is an example. you either know something or you do not\nalthough we do recognize degrees of knowledge, as in\n> i once knew german well, but now i remember only a bit.\nthe progressive tenses, however, relate to processes. the static and the\nprogressive are inconsistent ideas. so 'i am knowing german' may technically\nbe grammatical, but it is bad english because it implies a process within a\nstate and makes no sense. (someone will now come up with an example where the\nprogressive of 'know' does make sense, but it will not be an example of\nanything common.) we can say as a rule: only in very rare cases, if ever, is\nit good american english to use 'know' in a tense with progressive aspect.\nconsider the verb 'understand.' again, it describes a state that admits of\ndegree, but it does not imply a process.\n> i am understanding german\nto mean\n> i understand german\nis not idiomatic american english. it is easier, however, to find examples\nwhere the progressive may fit with 'understand' than with 'know'\n> it's amazing how well i am understanding german after only three days in\n> berlin\nis idiomatic although perhaps a bit crude compared to\n> it's amazing how much german i understand after only three days in berlin.\nso i am going to make up a rule\n**except for some modals, it is grammatically possible to put any verb into a\ntense with a progressive aspect, but, at least in american english, it is\nseldom idiomatic to put verbs of state into the progressive because it usually\nimplies a subtle contradiction between a state and a process.**\nnow consider 'find.' it is an action rather than a state so the previous rule\ncannot apply. nevertheless, the verb usually has a binary nature: something is\neither found or lost. 'find,' however, can sometimes mean 'seek,' 'search\nfor,' or 'look for,' which do describe processes and are not binary. when\n'find' is used in that sense, the progressive can certainly be used\nidiomatically.\n> i was finding my way in the dark when i stumbled over the cat and stubbed my\n> toe.\nit would not be idiomatic to convey that thought as\n> i found my way in the dark when i stumbled over the cat and stubbed my toe.\nthe 'when' signals an instant within a duration of time, and action across a\nduration calls for the progressive.\nwith respect to the two pairs of examples given in the edited question, i\nbelieve all four are idiomatic.\nwith respect to the first pair, i find the second sentence to be better\nbecause it reports on a state. i would change my mind if 'learn' were\nsubstituted for 'understand' because learning is a process. given that\nsubstitution, the two sentences become equally acceptable although the second\ndoes not imply that an attempt at learning is ongoing whereas the first seems\nto imply that such an attempt is ongoing. that is, both sentences are\nacceptable but may convey slightly different meanings.\nwith respect to the second pair, i definitely prefer the second sentence\nbecause the sense relates to a continuing period, rather than an instant.\nin conclusion, grammar should defer to meaning. this makes language difficult\nbecause simple rules cannot capture the complexities of all possible meanings,\nparticularly not in english with its huge vocabulary and subtle verb\nstructure."

'could not be happier' is excellent, but we say 'prince william and hrh catherine ~~are~~ could not be happier' - only one tensed verb ( _could_ ) per clause. and although the mother bears the style _princess william_ , she is referred to as _her royal highness catherine, duchess of cambridge_.\n0. 'the baby's name will be announced later' - you have the name of the tense right, but it is built without _have_ , which is part of the _perfect_ tenses\n0. the baby's grandfather is 'charles, prince of wales' - and he's not just _called_ that, he really **is** that!\n0. either 'when kate, accompanied by a midwife, **was** entering' or 'when kate, with a midwife, was entering' - singular, because kate-by-herself is the subject. or you could say 'when kate and a midwife **were** entering' - you need an _and_ to join them and make the subject plural. 'if believe sounds of witnesses' should probably be 'if the accounts of witnesses may be believed' - but there are lots of ways of saying this.\n0. 'in which the details **were given** ' ... 'going **back** to a time when there was not only **no** mobile' (the _not_ belongs to _only_ , not to _mobile_ ) 'but mostly no telephones' ... 'information message' is not english idiom; what you want is probably 'a notice' ... ' **was** put' ... and ' **in** a thunderous voice'.
