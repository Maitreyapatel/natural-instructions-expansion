            "input": "Question: i wonder whether reading the articles of the journals similar to the economist (including _time_ , etc) are in a style that make them difficult to flow even for native-readers? is the effort to read them is as smooth as other every day text for a native speaker (not a language learner)? for example consider the first paragraph of the following article: > sepahua, a ramshackle town on the edge of peru's amazon jungle, nestles in a > pocket on the map where a river of the same name flows into the urubamba. > that pocket denotes a tiny patch of legally loggable land sandwiched between > four natural reserves, all rich in mahogany and accessible from the town. > 'boundaries are on maps,' says a local logger, 'maps are only in lima,' the > capital. as a non-native speaker i can read almost all academic papers in various fields smoothly. it's not the case for the economist. the above example is not a complex one the context neither in vocabulary. but its sentences are composed in an unnatural way. so the question is: are any native speakers with a bachelor degree able to flow the economist as smooth as wikipedia articles? there are certainly far better examples to support the question, such as the following sentence which is convoluted enough to puzzle even native english speakers: > 'that they were mysteriously thwarted by democrats over the measure for > three legislative sessions in a row suggests that some compromise may still > be possible, if only behind closed doorsand, perhaps, among the university > working groups that right now are hammering out what campus carrya phrase > that almost everyone seems to have a strong view onactually means.' <url> law-may-yet-er-backfire-revenge-nerds \nAnswer: the economist is a serious publication. its stated mission is: 'to take part in a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress'. such a mission demands a high intellectual level of journalism and can be expected to demand high educational standards amongst its readers. it does not over-simplify issues to make them easier to understand. inevitably such a publication will tend to use sophisticated language that may be very difficult for non-native speakers to follow unless their command of english is very strong.",

            "input": "Question: is the following sentence correct? > there aren't lifeguards **services** in this season specifically, i'm wondering if the word _services_ should be plural or singular. \nAnswer: what do we mean by services in this particular context? i think we are talking about 'help given to someone, especially by using one's skills, ability, or knowledge' (macmillan dictionary). in this case 'service' can be both countable and uncountable, according to the same dictionary. if you mean something like 'our lifeguards will not be doing those things they normally have to, they will not work this season,' use 'services.' here's another example: > sarah offered her **services** as a childminder for the day. (they say > 'services' because there were a few things she actually had to do as a > childminder, there were a few responsibilities she offered to accept) _(the > sentence is from the macmillan dictionary)_ according to the collins dictionary, your **services** _(plural)_ are the things that you do or the skills that you use in your job, which other people find useful and are usually willing to pay you for. this sounds like the lifeguard services from your sentence because lifeguards' services are things they do, and which other people pay for. here's an example from collins: > the performers have all offered their **services** free of charge. therefore, i consider your sentence _'there aren't lifeguards **services** in this season'_ correct. _'there aren't **lifeguard** services'_ is also correct. _'there isn't lifeguard **service** '_ is also correct. but it's a bit different from 'there aren't lifeguard services.' a _service_ is something that the public needs, such as transport, communications facilities, hospitals, or energy supplies, which is provided in a planned and organized way by the government or an official body. therefore, when one says 'there isn't lifeguard service,' i understand that this need is not met. when i hear 'there aren't lifeguard services,' i understand that there are few services lifeguards provide, but for some reason they are not going to do it this season.",

'a or b or c' when there are three options: 1, 2, 3, where a, b, c are nouns or noun phrases, i'm wondering which is the best writing style. \nAnswer: the first two versions of the list are functionally identical. the only real difference is the absence and presence of the oxford comma. the use (or omission) of the comma before _or_ (or and) in lists is contentious, and the question linked by user3169 explains it well. for most english writers it boils down to a question of what they were taught to do as small children, or perhaps by an influential teacher at some other point in their lives. there are pros and cons to either usage, but the intended meaning is the same. the part of your question that isn't answered in the linked page is the difference between options 1 and 2 versus option 3. the inclusion of the word _or_ twice is sometimes used for emphasis. suppose i asked you to choose among a, b, and c (i was taught to use the comma by mrs. clark in 2nd grade. :) ) and you were struggling to make a single choice. i might repeat my question, including both articles and putting particular emphasis on the word _or_. adding that emphasis and repeating the word would demonstrate that you should choose one and only one option. to be clear, this is not a particularly formal style of writing, but it is good for spoken english if you really need to make your point about this sort of thing. > you can choose a **or** b **or** c. from harry potter (book 1): > 'students may bring an owl or a cat or a toad.' the repetition and capitalization make it clear that students are allowed to bring at most one pet from the list.",

'have you read the book?' some sentences do not have an aux. for instance: > 'you ate breakfast'. in this situation, we can pretend there is an **empty/null auxiliary** : > 'you {0} ate breakfast' when the question is formed, subject-aux inversion takes place with the empty aux, and we obtain > '{0} you ate breakfast?' it's an observed fact of english that we cannot have this null auxiliary at the start of a sentence. a process takes place called 'do affixing' whereby the empty auxiliary is replaced by the helping word 'do'. this word doesn't add any meaning; it serves a grammatical role. and when we replace {0} with do, we get: > 'do you ate breakfast?' oops, this is still not quite right. one more rule takes place. whenever we have an auxiliary present with a verb, the verb never takes the past tense. the verb can be a past participle, like 'been' in 'have been', or just a plain form like 'be' in 'should be'. a form like 'have was' is not grammatical because there is an auxiliary verb, and the main verb has past tense. the past tense, if any, has to be on the auxiliary verb, like in 'had been': 'had' is past tense, 'been' is a past participle. similarly when the word 'do' is the auxiliary, it has to take the past tense. 'do ate' is not grammatical. the past tense has to be transferred from 'ate' to 'do' to form 'did eat'. and that gives us the grammatically correct question: > 'did you eat breakfast?' so that is how you can understand why the 'did' is there. it's an auxiliary which is inserted to replace a null auxiliary once subject-aux inversion takes place (do affixing), and at the same time 'steals' the past tense from the main verb, because auxiliaries have to carry the tense when they are present! * * * ### part 2 so let us now look at 'what did you say' versus 'what you said'. firstly, what you said is a 'wh-clause'. the prototypical sentence for a wh- clause is still 'subject aux verb object' type syntax, such as: > you said what in english, in a wh-clause, the wh-word (who, what, when, ...) undergoes a transformation: it moves to the front of the sentence: > what you said 'what you said' is not a question. it is a clause which refers to something, functioning as a noun. in other words, a _nominal clause_. in this case, it refers to something which was said by 'you'. for example: 'i did not hear what you said. can you repeat it?' which means, 'i did not hear the words you spoke. can you repeat those words?' the clause 'what you said' has the same meaning as 'the words you spoke'; it functions much like a noun. 'what did you say?', on the other hand, is a question and not a nominal clause. it is formed like this: start with the prototypical sentence (subject verb object): > you said what then subject-aux inversion, with do-affixing takes place, to form a prototypical question: > did you say what lastly, the wh-word must move to the front of the sentence: > what did you say? (note, however, that 'you said what?' is a possible question and is grammatical, yet there is no movement of the wh-word, and no subject-aux inversion!) so in summary, 'what did you say?' is a question, whereas 'what you said' is a special kind of sentence called a nominal clause. both are related together because they are connected to the same subject-verb-object 'mother' sentence 'you said what'. the question is made by a question-forming process (subject- aux inversion, do affixing), and then a wh-movement (the wh-word moves to the front). the nominal clause is made just by wh-movement alone.",

'i am king' uses a null article (not a zero article). the zero article is the most indefinite article, and the null article is the most definite. peter master arranges articles in order from most indefinite to most definite: > zero (1)--some--a--the--null (2) > \\- peter master, 'acquisition of the zero and null articles in english', > issues in applied linguistics, 14(1) here's an example of the zero article and null article from the same paper: > * zero article: the boys ate chicken. > * null article: mr. jones was appointed chairman. > the _null article_ example has a similar quality to your 'second king' example. note that both _zero article_ and _null article_ refer to something that is absent from the sentence. it can seem a little odd to describe something missing as potentially having two polar opposite possibilities. masters goes on to say: > the zero and null articles can be readily distinguished by their > paraphrasability by either an indefinite or a definite article, respectively that is, if the sentence retains its sense when you insert an indefinite article, the original had a zero article. and if it retains its sense when you insert a (the) definite article, the original had a null article. with your example, '... i am king' has the sense of 'i am _the_ king', with everything that being king in that context entails. but that sense is lost when '... i am king' is paraphrased as 'i am _a_ king'. the original therefore has a null article. you ask: > can anyone explain why there is no indefinite article in front of the second > 'king'? that's because the sense of the second 'king' is a matter of identity, requiring the most definite article - the null article.",

(and those that can't) the listener is supposed to extrapolate to find missing information - the punchline of the joke. > (g) yo momma's so fat, the probability of her being in an arbitrary point in > a room is 1. 'yo momma's so fat' is the start of a series of 'humourous' insults. the joke subverts the listener's expectations by providing an intellectual punchline that suggests she is everywhere in a room, rather than a traditional insult. the reference to probability is a reference to quantum mechanics, similar to joke c. > (h) how many surrealists does it take to screw in a light bulb? a fish. surrealists are known for making art that contains strange things. this joke takes the form 'how many people of a certain type does it take to screw in a light bulb?' and provides a suitably surreal(ist) punchline. > (i) there's a band called 1023mb. they haven't had any gigs yet. 1024 mb (megabytes) = 1 gb (gigabyte). a gigabyte is often called a gig, which is also a word for a band's performance. the joke exploits this double meaning for humourous affect. * * * there are two parts to understanding these jokes. the first is to recognize that some of them are based on standard forms for jokes - 'your mother/yo momma is so 'insult', that 'elaboration of insult'', 'why did the 'something' cross the 'something'?', 'a 'something' walks into a bar', 'how many 'people of a certain profession' does it take to change a lightbulb?'. for instance, joke h could have equally been one of the following: 'yo momma is so surrealist, that fish diagonal exothermic.' 'why did the chicken go to the surrealist art gallery? it wanted to be enveloped by the melancholy fish of darkness.' 'a surrealist walks into a bar... of pressurized fish and delicious ideologies.' the second part to understanding the jokes is to understand the (sometimes fairly esoteric) references they make - to politics, physics and art, for instance. this would be the much harder part for the average english speaker. p.s. the other jokes on that page are also good.",

            "input": "Question: is the following sentence correct? > there aren't lifeguards **services** in this season specifically, i'm wondering if the word _services_ should be plural or singular. \nAnswer: the word ' **service** ' is very complicated, in usage. you can **give service** to someone or something, which is basically the same thing as saying that you **serve** that person or thing. a service can also be an organisation, such as the **royal voluntary service** (formerly _women's_ royal voluntary service), a uk charity, or a **police service** , **fire and rescue service** , or indeed a **_lifeguard service_**. countries have their **armed services** , often consisting of an army, a navy, and an air force - and maybe a separate service for marines. the army is _one_ armed service. as such, this is a countable noun. when you _give service_ , though, _service_ is a mass (uncountable) noun. on the other hand, you can **_provide (a) service(s)_**. giving service usually means something that isn't just about being paid to do something - often you aren't being paid at all, when it's **voluntary service** , such as to your church or a local charity. when you are in the military, that's often referred to as _giving service_ , and you may find politicians **thanking you for your service**. that's because there's a deliberate effort to giving more status to being in the military than it just being a job. when you _provide a service_ or _provide services_ , the word _service_ refers to something that you do for people or organisations. you might provide a _valet service_ for cars (which seems to mean something different in america and britain), or a _copywriting service_ to businesses that need text for their website or adverts. or you may provide _several_ services. now, the verb most closely associated with _service_ is, as i've mentioned, _to serve_. however, _service_ has also become a verb in its own right, such as the idea that you get a mechanic to **service your car** , meaning to give it a good mechanical going over to make sure everything works, replace worn or end-of-life parts, and so on. if you've taken your car to be serviced, you can say it's 'gone in **to be serviced** ', or 'gone in **for a service** ', particularly if it's gone in for, say, it's **50,000 mile service', a manufacturer-recommended thorough service to be taken once it has 50,000 miles on the clock (milometer). so, **_service_** , in all its myriad meanings, can be a singular or plural noun, a mass noun, or a verb. as a noun, it can also be used attributively, such as _service centre_ , a centre where service is provided - often a service whereby some equipment (such as a car) is _serviced_. in the case of the op's question, we can interpret things in several ways. 'lifeguard services' could mean several organisations that do what lifeguards do - save people from drowning, largely - or it could mean those very actions as services in the sense of things one person does for another. however, if there is normally only one organisation providing such services in the area, it could be singular to refer to that organisation. finally, while _lifeguard_ here is attributive, it could be genitive instead - **lifeguard's** or **lifeguards'** , to indicate that it is closely associated with one or several lifeguards. that would be unusual, but perfectly grammatical and semantically valid. so, there are different options, and they have slightly different meanings or implications, but 'lifeguard service', 'lifeguard services', 'lifeguard's service', 'lifeguards' service', 'lifeguard's services' and 'lifeguards' services' are all perfectly valid and reasonable terms that might be used. if you want to know what's generally used, you'll need to do some research. the version in the question, however, 'lifeguards services', is **not something you would ever expect to see**. it's not genitive, as there's no apostrophe, so it ought to be attributive - but attributive nouns should be singular.",

(i am unaware of _any_ community of english speakers that would utter 'mrs. firstname'.) properly speaking, which is to say in formal english, 'mr' and 'ms' (and 'miss' and 'mrs') are all applied to _last_ names, or _full_ names. so 'mr. smith' is fine. 'mr. john smith' is fine. 'mr. john' is really weird unless you are in some parts of the american south, and even then, i'm not sure you'd address a letter that way in a business context. second of all, part of why it feels weird is that in your example you address a woman as 'mrs.' at least in the us, one does not ever address a woman as 'mrs.' in a business context unless she has specifically indicated that it's her preferred title (same rules as 'capt.' and 'rev.') **precisely because it refers to her marital status**. the reason it feels weird to address a man and a woman that way when they're not married is that the 'mrs' title is explicitly making a comment about her being married. that is why using 'mrs.' is considered gauche in the workplace. same with 'miss'. the professional default title one uses for a woman is 'ms.' and she is addressed 'madam' (parallel to 'mr.'/'sir'). you may find that > dear mr. wu and ms. smith feels a lot less weird. should you find yourself needing to use 'mrs.' (say, in a social context, like writing wedding invitations), there's a whole archaic set of rules for its correct use, about which i am very hazy. (something like if jane doe marries john smith, she's mrs. john smith but not mrs. jane smith? i remember it was non-obvious and complicated.) refer to an etiquette manual. frankly, the correct rules for deploying 'mrs.' were complicated enough, that was what drove the widespread adoption of 'ms.' which works just like 'mr.'.",

'tautosyllabic' means _within the same syllable_. 2\\. /slashes/ represent 'sounds' (more precisely, the mental representation of sounds), **not** 'spelling'. 3\\. angled brackets represent 'orthography' (spelling).",

'school' is pronounced as with a 'k', not a 'g', and 'stay' is pronounced with a 't', not a 'd'. that said, everyone interested in (or puzzled about) this question should make those sounds over and over again (that is, say, _'t- t- t- t-, d- d- d- d-, t- t- t- t-, d- d- d- d-_...' and then say, _'k- k- k- k-, g- g- g-, k- k- k- k-, g- g- g-'_ ), while paying close attention to what your tongue is doing in your mouth. if you're doing it correctly, you'll find the tongue doing pretty much the exact same thing even as you switch letters from _t_ to _d_ (and again from _k_ to _g_ ); the difference is in the breathing and the noises we emit. consequently, when the sound is in the middle of the word, particularly after an 's' (as in _describe_ ), even when the speaker is trying to say a 'k', it can end up sounding much like a 'g'. that said, you should never _try_ to pronounce the 'g' when you are supposed to be sounding out a 'k' strive for the right letter, but don't be surprised or alarmed if it comes out sounding like what i will call its 'partner letter.'.",

'is' indicates a status; 'angry' is the status. you can say, 'she became angry.' again, 'angry' is the status. 'became' indicates a change in status, here presumably from not-angry to angry. also, 'she seemed angry'. maybe she wasn't actually angry, but this was her apparent status. you cannot generally use a predicate adjective with other sorts of verbs. you cannot say, 'she lived angry', because 'lived' does not call for a status. you could say 'she lived angrily' or 'she lived with her anger', or many other possible wordings to say that anger was a constant state in her life. 'she walks wet' is really borderline. fluent speakers do say things like that. like, 'sally climbed out of the swimming pool and walked across the yard wet.' it's strained grammatically but we know what you mean: she walked, and she was wet. similarly you could say 'she entered the room angry', that is, when she entered the room, she was angry.",

'i promise to _not_ misbehave.' as in something a kid would say to convince its parents that it will behave well? \nAnswer: some people think it's important to avoid 'splitting infinitives.' in these sentences, 'to misbehave' is an infinitive verb and 'splitting' it means inserting a word between the 'to' and the 'misbehave.' in your example 2, 'promise to not misbehave' is a split infinitive. i happen to think this is an entirely pointless rule. sometimes it makes more sense, either because of clarity, or as andrew says, because of the sound of the sentence to split the infinitive. one commonly cited example of a split infinitive that sounds much better split is that _star trek_ slogan, 'to boldly go where no one has gone before.' this breaks the split infinitive rule - which would tell you that it must be 'to go boldly' or 'boldly to go' - but sounds much nicer. additionally, in some circumstances repositioning the 'not' can subtly change the meaning of the statement: > be aware that putting 'not' or another adverb between 'to' and its verb adds > some emphasis to that adverb. for example, in the sentence 'they decided not > to stay another night' the phrase 'they decided' is the most important > information, but the sentence 'they decided to not stay another night' tells > us that maybe they decided to stay another night before, but now it is > important that they will not stay. > <url>.",

'he slew the wolf' sounds like he fought with it on equal terms (or terms that were not favorable to him), and accomplished something by killing it; 'he murdered the wolf' focuses on having killed a living being, and has a pronounced tone of disapproval. > homicide literally killing a person. more of a legal term. > massacre killing of a large number of people (or 'multiple people' at least--the boston massacre actually only resulted in the deaths of five people after all). usually there is a tone of disapproval, though in metaphoric usage it's similar to 'slaughter' above ('we massacred them' in the context of a sporting event means our team won by a large margin.).",

'i've only been there once' is certainly more idiomatic, and you might be able to argue that it emphasizes the _only_ a bit more since it appears nearer the beginning of the sentence. but there is no difference in meaning. to elaborate on the possible small distinction in emphasis that could be made: > i've been there **only once**. the statement is that you _have indeed_ been there; but you're adding that you've only been there one time. > i've **only** been there once. you're leading with the _only_ , emphasizing that your being there has **only happened one time**. but this is a very slight distinction, and the _meaning_ (that you've been there one single time) is exactly the same no matter which way you phrase it. i think 'i've only been there once' is more idiomatic, but beyond that it's your choice which you use.",

'tantalized' is associated with hunger, and originates from a greek myth about a man tormented by food and drink forever just out of reach. the smell of a fine restaurant might be tantalizing to a hungry man, or a fat wallet might be tantalizing to a thief. 'enticed' is usually playing to someone's sense of greed. you might entice customers with a sale, or entice a strange dog with a treat. enticed also implies something that is available for a reasonable price, as opposed to a forbidden temptation or an unreachable tantalization. the tricky thing here is that all three of these could work for your jewelry example, depending upon how she felt about the purchase. all three of these words imply that there is a reason why she should not pursue the jewelry, but she is considering pursuing it anyway. choosing the appropriate word tells us more about her motivations. i would choose 'tempting' if she is held back by her morals, 'tantalizing' if it is beyond her reach (perhaps requiring her to leave her comfort zone and take a risk), or 'enticed' if she is simply weighing the budget.",

'i support' indicates an ownership, a firmer association implying a greater commitment of resources or shared ideals with the thing in question. take for example 'i lend my support to the community kitchen when i can.' versus 'i support the community kitchen.'. the latter implies a greater commitment usually, as this could literally mean that the person is providing the primary source of operating capital, human resources or something else essential to operation. as such, this automatically implies a deeper commitment to the cause in question.",

'she' is **third-person singular**. the verb 'does' is a singular too. now what makes the distinction is what our mind interprets. we think the sentence 'she has a book' is equivalent to 'she does have a book'. this is where the negative comes from. **do** and its derived form **does** are auxiliary verbs used for framing assertive and interrogative sentences. and auxiliary verbs are followed by the raw forms of the verbs, in this case ' **have** '. ' _has_ ' is not the raw or primary verb. this is different from the notion of saying 'she has a book/books' or 'i have a book/books'. here the concept of using 'do' as an auxiliary verb is not present. however, making a negative out of it certainly requires the addition of the auxiliary verb. hence we say the following as an answer to the question _' does she have a book?'_, > she has the book. > > she does not have a book. ( _'she' is the third-person singular._ ) and the following as answer to _' do you have a book?'_ > i have a book. > > i do not have a book. ( _'i' is the first-person singular._ ).",

            "input": "Question: i know some meanings of this word but i want to know what it means in detail. can anyone tell me? \nAnswer: first of all, 'geek' is slang, so it is much less about strict definition than it is about the associations that speakers have with the term and the people it is applied to. second, those associations have been changing quite a bit recently. third, some groups make distinctions between this word and some related words (principally 'nerd'), while others treat them as synonymous. so this is going to be a long answer, where i try to impart the associations that i have, and i have seen others have, using the word. anyway, with that in mind, 'geek' was originally an insult, and is sometimes still used that way though that is diminishing recently. specifically, it meant to imply that the geek in question shares some of the qualities associated with a particular stereotype. that stereotype has been eroded recently, but we'll start with the original stereotype, particularly its depictions in movies and television, which informed many english-speakers of the stereotype and thus which people could be called geeks. but first, ### the 'too long, didn't read' version originally, geek was an insult referencing a stereotypical high school clique, associated with poor social skills and an unfathomable interest in math, science, or other technical and unpopular matters. it became more broadly applied to any kind of interest that others without the same interests couldn't understand. between the broadening of who could be considered a geek, and years of movies and television portraying geeks as the underdog protagonist, the term has been reclaimed, and many people now refer to themselves as geeks and would not be insulted by being called one. ultimately, however, its history as an insult means that it should be used with some care. ### the original stereotype 'the geeks' are depicted, in media, as a kind of archetypal school clique, at least in america. the stereotypical depiction is a small and skinny (or, on the flip side, obese: primarily, not physically fit) white (both as in caucasian, and as in being particularly pale) male, with neither talent nor interest in sports or physical activity, and a passion for science, mathematics, or other technical matters that his classmates do not share. they are contrasted with various other archetypal cliques. again, stereotypically, the geeks are a small group, close to the bottom of the social ladder, and often lack much social skill (read: awkward and nervous around girls, unable to convincingly stand up to bullies or even engender much sympathy from others while being bullied). they do tend to be portrayed with fairly close friendships within the clique, however. 'the geeks' typically are contrasted with 'the jocks,' the athletes, who are usually the most popular guys in school. this, of course, mirrored reality to _some_ degree, though no school is actually exactly as depicted in movies or television. now, while stereotypically, media frequently depicts geeks as being interested in technical matters, this was never (so far as i can tell) the true mark of the geek. for instance, being interested in car mechanics has almost never been seen as geeky: cars are cool, popular, even sexy, definitely not geeky. on the other hand, interest in superhero comics, video games and even more so tabletop games, fantasy and science fiction media, and so on have all been associated with geeks, even though these are not at all technical. it is far more about being interested in unpopular things than it is about math and science (though these subjects are typically fairly unpopular in adolescence). ### expanded application: _any_ strong interest in an activity the word geek is also appended to all manner of activities to indicate a very strong interest in it. 'drama geek' is a very common term for people interested in theater for example, for example. note that more popular or physical activities are still rarely associated with the term, however, unless the interest goes well beyond what is popular. for example, dancing is quite popular; enjoying dance or being good at it is unlikely to be described as geeky. but someone who really gets into dance theory and practices dance regularly for its own sake _might_ be called a dance geek (though i'll admit i've never heard that particular usage). also, people who do something professionally, or at an expert level, are rarely described as geeks (unless one is discussing their origins); a movie star might say they got their start as a drama geek, but it would be unusual to call them a drama geek now. ultimately, i suspect this is simply because the term was supposed to be an insult; it's hard to insult someone's interests when those interests make them money or are recognized as world-class. ### broadened demographics furthermore, the associations have changed with time. non-white geeks (the chinese or indian geek has become almost as bad a stereotype as the original pale geek), female geeks, and physically-fit geeks have become much more common. depictions of geeks with notable social skills are less common, but more often their social skills are depicted as merely 'normal,' rather than sub-par. ### narrative role it's really important to remember that geeks were an important part of american movies and television. in particular, they served the role of the underdog protagonist in a lot of media based in american high schools (roughly age 14-18). they were bullied, socially anxious, and unpopular, which made them easy to relate to. this became especially pronounced as more interests could be associated with geeks, and geeks' social ineptitude shifted to more typical teenager awkwardness. ### reclamation in recent years, geek has become a largely reclaimed term. many people proudly label themselves geek, including people who really wouldn't have fit the stereotype and probably never would have had it used against them as a stereotype. 'geeking out' just means to get excited about something that doesn't excite everyone, which almost anyone will do on occasion. furthermore, the technical fields that were originally associated with geeks have become much more popular, thanks to the explosion of personal computers and the internet. these days, geekiness is a fairly popular trait, and being a geek is not really seen as being a member of a clique so much as just having interests particular to you that get you really excited. the primary qualification is that you can get excited about something, and have others be completely baffled by your excitement. for instance, i get really excited about new forms of web technology, mark-up languages, and programming. plenty of people in my life would be completely mystified if i tried to explain why some development had me excited, though. this definition, of course, is exceptionally broad, and almost anyone can self-label themselves a geek, and it's become increasingly difficult to actually use as an insult if one were so inclined, because a lot of people see it as a good thing in the first place. for example, john green has a fairly popular video which includes the following quote about how 'nerd' is a weak insult: > because nerds like us are allowed to be unironically enthusiastic about > stuff nerds are allowed to love stuff, like jump-up-and-down-in-the-chair- > can't-control-yourself love it. hank, when people call people nerds, mostly > what they're saying is 'you like stuff.' which is just not a good insult at > all. like, 'you are too enthusiastic about the miracle of human > consciousness.' that said, this is a rather recent change in the popular understanding of the term, and some, particularly those who are older and grew up with its use as a negative, may still see it as an insult. certainly, the original stereotype of a geek _is_ fairly insulting.",

'sarcasm' is a particular way of expressing an opinion. if i use parody, satire, or mocking to make a point, i am being 'sarcastic'. if i imply that someone 'ought to know better' than to say something (that they said), i am also being sarcastic. for example, if i say that 'most people care about human life', or that 'christians and jews believe that god created mankind in god's image', or that 'many christians accept the idea of evolution', i am stating facts about many people's opinions. these statements directly rebut dawkins' claim that being 'pro-human-life... is hard to reconcile with the fact of evolution.' if i say that 'a prominent intellectual ought to know better than to imply that most anti-abortionists are ignorant of science', then i am treating dawkins sarcastically. by this standard, dawkins is clearly being 'sarcastic', not just 'opinionated'. if an argument relies on obvious fallacies, then it is not logical. if an argument is neither logical, nor relies on experimental evidence, then it is not scientific.

'have you washed your hands since you came home today?' if he has been in and out of the house three times since getting home from school...

'sensual' and 'sensuous', for example, are slightly different in a way that many native speakers might not know: > **sensual** (adj): _relating to or consisting in the gratification of the > senses or the indulgence of appetite_ > > **sensuous** (adj): _of or relating to the senses or sensible objects, > having strong sensory appeal_ some suffixes have consistent meaning, for example '-ized' generally means 'became like' or 'make like' > it is a **sensational** headline (it's a headline designed to arouse strong > sensations) > > it is a **sensationalized** headline (it's been made sensational by someone > or something) however this doesn't account for nuance. for example 'idealized' suggests a _false_ or _unrealistic_ ideal. > she was an **ideal** leader (she represented the best qualities of a leader) > > she was an **idealized** leader (she was believed to be an ideal leader, but > this was more wishful thinking than reality) so the solution is to read a lot to learn the meaning of adjectives like these _in context_ , and pick up the patterns. it's much too broad a question to list the meanings of every possible adjective suffix. many of your examples are not correct -- _modulation_ is a noun, _pursuing year_ is not idiomatic, _persuasion_ is a noun, and _pursuing_ and _persuasion_ are not related -- but if you have questions about any specific suffix, that we could probably answer. list of common adjective suffixes and their meanings.",

'i've just finished three pages,' they'd say at the end of the day; and their books mounted up. but ours never did, though one morning allen wrote four pages to his novel, very brilliant. **we were in a little study together separated by a screen**. i was heaping up books on jonathan edwards and taking notes, and getting more and more numb on the subject, looking at old leather-bound volumes on freedom of the will and so on, and feeling less and less a calling. and there we stuck. and then we decided to make an anthology together. we both liked rather formal, difficult poems, and we were reading particularly the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. in the evening we'd read aloud, and we started a card catalog of what we'd make for the anthology. and then we started writing. it seems to me we took old models like drayton's odetate wrote a poem called 'the young proconsuls of the air' in that stanza. i think there's a trick to formal poetry. most poetry is very formal, but when a modern poet is formal he gets more attention for it than old poets did. somehow we've tried to make it look difficult. for example, shelley can just rattle off terza rima by the page, and it's very smooth, doesn't seem an obstruction to himyou sometimes wish it were more difficult. well, someone does that today and in modern style it looks as though he's wrestling with every line and may be pushed into confusion, as though he's having a real struggle with form and content. marks of that are in the finished poem. and i think both tate and i felt that we wanted our formal patterns to seem a hardship and something that we couldn't rattle off easily. \nAnswer: considering it's in a study they probably mean a decorative folding room divider like this one. i think your confusion is probably because 'screen' has many meanings. but i think we can rule out a hanging mosquito net or a panel for projecting light onto. ![a room divider screen](<url>).",

(in formal mathematics the situation is different, 'set' is an _undefined term_ and it, along with the _undefined expression_ 'is a member of' are used in some axioms such as 'the emptyset is a set' and 'the union of two sets is a set'. anything theory that obeys these axioms is a set theory.) mathematically it would be possible to define a structure like you describe. as far as i know nobody has found a need to do so, and so no such structure has been named. (the mathematical structure would be a mapping f from some underlying set a to the set {n \\in z | n>1} where f(x) represents the number of times each item occurs. this is a trivial modification of the definition of a 'multiset') in common use 'set' means something different: it is a collection of objects that are to be used together in some way: we talk about 'a set of golf clubs' or 'a set of fine china teacups' there is no particular requirement that the objects be different from each other, indeed you would expect all the teacups to look the same. we haven't needed a word with the exact meaning you specify, and i believe none exists in english. however if you are looking for a class name in a programming language 'multiset' would do fine.",

'x' divided by 'y'? \nAnswer: there are a few possibilities, depending on preference and the nature of what you are writing. in the context of an essay, novel, etc., and in older texts it would be usual to express fractions as a numerator/denominator combination. so 1/4 -> one quarter; 3/4 -> three quarters; 7/64 -> seven sixtyfourths. note the special cases: 1/2 -> one half, 1/4 -> one quarter. otherwise the denominator is changed to the ordinal number form. the form you give, 'x divided by y' is fine, but is normally used in an explanatory sense, to emphasise the operation which is being carried out, rather than the resulting fraction. in many modern texts, 'x over y' is common, and is more or less universal when y becomes large. so one might use (x+1)/(x-1) -> 'x plus one over x minus one', 17/121 -> seventeen over one two one. but even when that form is being used, you'd not usually use 1/2 -> 'one over two' - you'd almost always say 'one half', 'one quarter', even 'one eighth'. and by the way, in english speaking environments where decimal measures are not fully used, you'll sometimes find expressions like 'one thou' for 1/1000 - usually one thousandth of an inch!.",

[do you] want to come? > > seen on signs: [i am/we are] out to lunch; [i/we will be] back at 1:00 > [p.m]. in speech, when pronouns are not dropped, they are more often elided than other words in an utterance. you asked whether there is a rule or not. as you see in some examples presented above, this type of removal mostly happen to 'you' as the subject and the auxiliary preceding it in yes/no questions e.g. > '[do you] want to come?' and 'i' when it's the subject in a sentence and the auxiliary following it e.g your friend's calling your name and you say, > '[i'm] coming!'.",

(location - in that place) * he went there. (goal - to that place) we sometimes need extra help to show the listener the place that we are talking about being in or going to. we might point, for example. if the place is not very close, we can say _over there_. this helps guide the listener to a location a bit further away than they might expect. the preposition _there_ is a different word from the pronoun _there_. the pronoun _there_ does not have any meaning. we use it in sentences which show that something exists: * we need to stop. * why? * there's a problem. the word _there_ in the sentence above is not talking about a location. the sentence just means ' _a problem exists_ '. in this sentence the word _there_ has no meaning at all.",

'i went to sleep at six': i was awake at 5:59, but asleep at 6:00. 'i slept at six': i went to sleep some time before 6:00 and woke up some time after 6:00, so at the exact time i was asleep. example usage: 'i called you on the phone but you didn't answer'. 'when did you call?' 'i called at six. what were you doing that kept you from answering?' 'i slept at six, that's why i didn't answer'. usually you would say 'i was asleep' instead of 'i slept'.",

(the act of pulling fruit off of a tree is always 'picking', but you still took them after you picked them, and you still got them by taking them.) however, if someone gave you the apples, you would probably use get; 'take' would have the sense of 'did not refuse the gift' in this case. if aunt sally gives you a bag of apples and you bring them home, this conversation could take place: > hey! i just got some apples! > how did you get them? > aunt sally gave them to me and i took them home. if farmer joe drives by with a truckload of apples, and makes you a gift of four of the best of them, and you bring them home, this conversation could take place: > hey! i just got some apples! > how did you get them? > farmer joe said to pick the four best ones from his truck and take them > home.",

'she' is the correct singular-female pronoun to refer to 'lucy,' but this responses focuses on the wrong verb - 'think/thought' instead of 'invite.' it's a distractor that references the words used in the original statement, but in an incorrect way. the statement isn't about what lucy thought, so this answer doesn't make sense. > 2) why did **she**? why did who do what? 'she' in this case can only refer to lucy. there's nothing in the statement to indicate lucy _did_ anything. the people who _did_ something are the 'we' referred to by the speaker. since the pronouns are incompatible and referring to the wrong person this response is incorrect. > 3) did **they** accept? this response focuses on the proper verb: 'invite.' it requires that the listener recognize that the verb 'accept' is used to respond positively to an invitation. it's incorrect, however, because 'they' is a pronoun for a group, not for a single person, so it cannot refer to lucy. 'did **she** accept?' would be ok. > 4) why didn't **you**? as you noted, this is the correct answer. 'you' in english can refer to a single person (the speaker) or a group (the 'we' mentioned by the speaker). the sentence indicates that they _thought_ about inviting lucy, but they did not (otherwise they would likely say 'we _invited_ lucy to come with us). the complete idea is 'why didn't you [invite her]?'.",

'things' would be correct in most cases, but it doesn't particularly reveal _what kind of things_ we are talking about. * * * * what about equipment and tools? **equipment** seems the most generic description available. tools are a form of equipment. * what about food, drinks and other beverages and fruit, vegetables? **food** can include both food and drinks, when used in the most general sense of the word. * what about weaponry, suits, night-vision goggles, helmets, grenades and ammunition? **materiel**. this is an established term (most often used in military context, but according to merriam webster it is also correct in a corporate environment). * what about medicine? **medicine**. if your question only lists a single type of item, then that is the correct name to use :) * what about plants, flowers, different trees and other? we tend to use **flora** , which comes from fauna and flora. quite literally, it translates to 'animals (fauna) and plants (flora)'. **plants** would of course also be correct, but flora implies a more general biological definition. * what about oxygen, hydrogen, different chemicals and substances? chemicals would be correct. however, people (wrongly) infer 'chemicals' as 'dangerous liquid compounds'. substances would also be correct, but it is a bit vague. it also carries a connotation of being related to drugs. e.g. 'substance abuse' inherently refers to alcohol and drugs. i would use **chemicals**. in my opinion, we should not avoid using the word because some people _wrongly_ infer a different meaning. * what about living organisms and specimens and test subjects? if you use flora for plants, i would use fauna for animals. however, if all of the cargo can be considered test subjects, i would refer to them as such. 'specimens' is too vague, because saliva swabs are also specimens but by no means an animal. note: 'living organisms' can also include bacteria and microscopic life forms.

(and the reverse happens when we try to learn one of these languages.) a similar story holds for /p/ vs. /b/ and also for /t/ vs. /d/. (contrast /s/ and /z/, where the only distinction is voicing -- there is no puff of air on the /s/. here, english speakers do tend to voice the /z/ strongly and immediately.) now, the interesting thing about the 'puff of air' is that we don't do if the consonant comes after an /s/. (so /sp/, /st/, and /sk/ are all unvoiced, and no air puff.) you might think we would then confuse these sounds with /sb/, /sd/, and /sg/, but luckily, these latter clusters do not occur in english words, so there is no risk of confusion. therefore your dictionary, which tells you to say /g/ after /s/, is half right and half wrong. it's right because you shouldn't puff the air, but wrong because you shouldn't use your voice box. luckily the risk of misunderstanding here is very small, so if you were working on modifying 'one step at a time' till you sound more like a native speaker, i would make this step very late in the process.",

'these' is plural, so 'kinds of projects' all needs to plural too. most of the modern examples found in google books i'd consider the results of imperfect proof-reading. the exception to the rule may be the more historical books cited in your search results. i believe we may see in some of them something akin to words like 'coin' where what we usually consider a singular can be used as a plural when speaking in a general sense. for example in phrases like 'i paid in coin' and 'do you have any coin?' the latter phrase i consider unusual in modern english, but not ungrammatical. so in cobett's _parliamentary history_ we see the phrase 'and the sovereign prince hath imparted and withdrawn these kind of favours'. my belief is (which a better grammarian than me may be able to confirm) that using singular forms as plurals was more common in the past when speaking in general terms. cobett uses the phrase twice, and a search through early modern sources in _medieval and early modern sources online_ (<url>) reveals 'these kind of' is used 72 times, compared with just 27 instances of what we would now consider the grammatically correct 'these kinds of'.",

'lookup' already has a specific meaning in another context, as a lookup table, which is a noun. i would argue that 'lookup' should never be at the start of a function name. the separable verb 'to look something up' would mean that it would require camel-case, ie. 'lookupaccountname'. i could imagine it as a noun however, e.g. 'accountnamelookup', which i would expect to be some sort of hash table. 'lookedupname' seems redundant. 'foundname' as a variable also seems potentially misleading in a programming context, as depending on your implementation, if it _wasn't_ found, then it could contain null, false, empty or whatever. just use 'account' and make sure that it _is_ there, through whatever language constructs are available.",

(is there anything wrong with the punctuation, i wonder?) source: <url> absorb-extra-cost-pricier-imports-consumers-will-foot-bill-how \nAnswer: _even_ has a couple of meanings, one of them means 'same level as something else' ('even _with_ x' or 'x and y are even'), and another is 'not tilted' ('x is even'). an unrelated additional meaning, when used as an modifier/adverb, is hard to explain. it's something like an intensifier. google's definition explains it well: 'used to emphasize something surprising or extreme.' it's a lot like the word _only_ in that it's position in a sentence is flexible and the meaning of the sentence changes depending on where it appears. > i didn't even to go work today.

(though it's too written by a non-native) this led me to think whether... * the use of unnecessarily long words (which don't quite go with the context) make even correct english seem broken. * it's a bad practice. ...or it's just pedantic of me. \nAnswer: andrew's answer deals with your sentence well and ought to be accepted (in my opinion), but i'll just use the occasion to address the more general question you asked. there is a long history in english style of recommending concision. for many authors, no further authority is needed than that of strunk & white's _elements of style_ , because most modern style guides have either built on or made allusion to that work anyway. in their section 'omit needless words' (scroll down on this page), they give a few examples of corrections to make: > the question as to whether whether (the question whether) > there is no doubt but that no doubt (doubtless) > used for fuel purposes used for fuel > he is a man who he > in a hasty manner hastily > this is a subject which this subject > his story is a strange one. his story is strange. i can't find a particular reference for individual word length, but their philosophy makes it plain that they would also recommend using shorter ones when possible: > vigorous writing is concise. a sentence should contain **no unnecessary > words** , a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a > drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. presumably a word should likewise have no unnecessary letters. but a key part of this advice is often given too little weight despite being intuitively correct: > this requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he > avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that **every > word tell**. that is, this principle requires that **every word contribute to the meaning**. this is a good principle. however, some nuance can be added. (actually, strunk & white, while a good manual of style for most, sometimes rankles those who can reliably judge style themselves, and it's not useful as a grammar reference.) besides stressing once more the 'no _unnecessary_ words' part of the advice, the main caveat i would add is this. it's quite possible to reduce sentences to gnomic, pithy kernels of their meaning. since i have experience editing for a newspaper and reviewing beginner code, my instinct is to do just that: reword, delete, simplify. **but this doesn't always achieve the purpose of a text, which is clear communication.** an example from programming might be useful. take java. according to the grammar of the language, all that is _necessary_ to distinguish meaning is that names be unique. thus, a class could have properties and methods named _a_ , _b_ , _c_ , and _d_ and comply with this grammar. the compiler certainly would not complain. it would have no trouble understanding you perfectly. if you ran out of letters you could start to use _aa_ , _bb_... but it would not be readable by humans! so you might allow yourself to sacrifice some concision in return for clarity and settle on _ts_ , _temp_ , _updatets_ , _readtemp_. this is still fairly concise, and the extra letters help you guess what you're doing. but still... it's only understandable to someone who already has an idea of what you're trying to do. what do you often find in the real world? try _timestamp_ , _temperatureincelsius_ , _updatetimestamp_ , _readtemperatureincelsiusfromthermometer_ , and so on. the conventions, in light of the need for comprehensibility by someone who may never have seen the code before, often favour verbosity over concision. the same idea applies to english. there is a certain ideal, crystallized style in which no words are wasted. it feels wonderful to chip away at a sentence till you have such a style, using the most precise words, and there's a certain satisfaction in understanding such a sentence. **but if you ever have to choose between that concision and being absolutely sure that your meaning gets across, choose the latter.** to illustrate this point, here's a concise sentence: > popular films infantilize if they fail to distinguish consciousnesses. here's a verbose version: > hollywood movies make us more childlike as viewers when they assume that our > experiences of the world are totally shared, not distinct that is, when > they implicitly deny the theory of mind developed early in our childhoods. which sentence did you get more out of? the second is just paraphrase of and extrapolation from the first, and is several times as long. but in a textbook, the first one will either be read three times by an attentive student or skimmed over by an inattentive student, however elegant it is as english. this is more extreme than the example you cited, of course, but it should give an idea of the value of unpacking your thought. by all means, aim for short sentences and chip away at unnecessary words; the world has far too many of them. but meaning isn't the only baby to avoid throwing out with the bathwater its twin is the ability to be widely understood.",

(if 'chicago > office tower' is the proper name of one particular building, then it would > be, 'the chicago office tower is ...') > > the first wolverine comic art was sold for nearly $660,000. > > babe ruth's watch was sold for $650,108. etc. 'is to be sold' is a somewhat complex construction, but it usually means the same as 'will be sold'.",

'an hour break' is also acceptable. people sometimes say 'an hour-long break'. though you might argue that that just adds an extra word for no good reason. it's not 'an hour's break' as the break does not belong to the hour: a possessive is not appropriate. if you had a five minute break every hour, you might say 'this hour's break', that is, the break for this hour.",

'big' can also mean _significant, important, etc._ maybe you did something important or memorable. maybe you're the boss. as for 'g', calling someone by their first initial is not unheard of. i can't think of a famous person, but some people go by 'j' or 'jay' ( _despite_ 'j' being short for the slang word 'joint', meaning _marijuana cigarette_ ). furthermore, this is common when someone has a name that is difficult for english speakers to pronounce. i've seen lots of teachers and professors go by a single letter, for example, a 'mr. k'. lastly, even if they did mean 'big gangsta', it's not necessarily an insult. it doesn't have to mean that you're some kind of criminal. it could be a metaphoric way to highlight some of your features. maybe you are a cool person who's rebellious. in any case, there's no need to be concerned. unless you have a good reason to believe they're being malicious, you can just take it to be an endearing nickname. others will take it the same way.",

'as' can also mean 'because'. for example, 'as you were here first, you can choose whatever seat you want.' because of this, (b) creates the possible ambiguity that the writer may mean, 'while i was asleep ...' or 'because i was asleep ...'. that's the only reason i can think of to prefer (a).",

'i've just finished three pages,' they'd say at the end of the day; and their books mounted up. but ours never did, though one morning allen wrote four pages to his novel, very brilliant. **we were in a little study together separated by a screen**. i was heaping up books on jonathan edwards and taking notes, and getting more and more numb on the subject, looking at old leather-bound volumes on freedom of the will and so on, and feeling less and less a calling. and there we stuck. and then we decided to make an anthology together. we both liked rather formal, difficult poems, and we were reading particularly the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. in the evening we'd read aloud, and we started a card catalog of what we'd make for the anthology. and then we started writing. it seems to me we took old models like drayton's odetate wrote a poem called 'the young proconsuls of the air' in that stanza. i think there's a trick to formal poetry. most poetry is very formal, but when a modern poet is formal he gets more attention for it than old poets did. somehow we've tried to make it look difficult. for example, shelley can just rattle off terza rima by the page, and it's very smooth, doesn't seem an obstruction to himyou sometimes wish it were more difficult. well, someone does that today and in modern style it looks as though he's wrestling with every line and may be pushed into confusion, as though he's having a real struggle with form and content. marks of that are in the finished poem. and i think both tate and i felt that we wanted our formal patterns to seem a hardship and something that we couldn't rattle off easily. \nAnswer: in this case it's a room divider. usually a folding screen used to divide two parts of a room or separate a smaller part from the rest, maybe conceal something. you've probably seen one type of it many times in movies or tv shows, usually a woman changes behind one.",

'overclaiming' is something referred to in the preceding paragraphs and is a particular _type_ of bragging. the ' _overclaiming measure_ ' therefore is a way of _assessing_ or _measuring_ that behaviour from a psychology point of view. when it goes on to say ' _that assessment of bragging which taps you know about something that you don't_ ' it is an _explanation_ of what the writer means by 'the overclaiming measure'. i feel that, as the article strongly suggests bragging in its many forms is a _compulsion_ for some types of people, it is like a resource that a person ' _taps into_ '. so 'overclaiming' _taps_ (or draws from) the bragger's desire to claim to know more about something than they actually do.",
